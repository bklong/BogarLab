```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Counts reads in our data to get an idea of how big the files are:

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
#this is imperfect and needs to be modified to tell us how many reads per fastq file
for file in *.fastq.gz; do
    echo "Processing file: $file"
    # Command to count reads in the fastq file
    read_count=$(zcat "$file" | echo $(( $(wc -l) / 4 )))
    echo "Reads in $file: $read_count"
done
```

Download the TRCI transcriptome on personal computer and move it to server:

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
#this code goes in the personal computer terminal
scp -P 22345 /c/Users/britt/Documents/Trucit1_1_EST_20220613_cluster_consensi.fasta.gz bklong@bogarprecision.plb.ucdavis.edu:~/DemRNAanalysis/TRCItranscriptome
```

Using Kallisto to index genome:

Required argument:
-i, --index=STRING
Add a file name for the kallisto index to be constructed.

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
kallisto index -i TRCI.index Trucit1_1_AssemblyScaffolds.fasta
```
