```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Kazu's method for combining two reference fasta files (two genomes)/(two transcriptomes) into one before indexing and then mapping:

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
cat first.fasta second.fasta > new_combined.fasta
```

something like the above...play around with it later
