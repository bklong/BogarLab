```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

I will use this doc to do enrichment analysis/function of the 29 interaction DEGs I found in PM.

```{r}
DEGs <- read.csv("PM.interaction.DEGs.csv") 
DEGs
```

GTF file maybe?

```{r}
library(data.table)
library(R.utils)

# Read the GTF file as a data.table
gtf <- fread("Psme.1_0 (1).gtf.gz")

head(gtf)
```

trying the CDS file instead...

```{r}
library(Biostrings)

# Read the CDS FASTA file
cds_sequences <- readDNAStringSet("Psme.1_0.cds.fa.gz")

# Print the sequences to inspect
cds_sequences
```
let's try to extract sequence from specific genes:

```{r}
DEG1 <- cds_sequences["PSME_21469"]
print(DEG1)
```
```{r}
DEG1 <- as.character(DEG1)
print(DEG1)
```
