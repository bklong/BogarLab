**Basic steps for DGE Analysis:**

1.  Load the RNAseq counts.
2.  Normalize the counts.
3.  QC the counts.
4.  Create a data frame that describes the experiment.
5.  Determine the dispersion parameter (how over-dispersed is the data?)
6.  Fit a statistical model for gene expression as a function of experimental parameters.
7.  Test the significance of experimental parameters for explaining gene expression.
8.  Examine result.
