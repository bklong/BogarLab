Let's copy TO sequence into a separate directory within my username that I can work on without ruining the raw data.

okaygirl so this is what you do:

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
ssh -p 22345 -l bklong bogarprecision.plb.ucdavis.edu

mkdir TO16S

cd TO16S

mkdir TO16S.seqs

cd

cd /data/Metabarcoding_DeepOaks_TejonOaks/p56ofydo/Unaligned/Project_LBAG_TODO_LP_MP1/

ls -d ~/TO16S/TO16S.seqs #checks to see if directory is found before trying to copy

cp TO* ~/TO16S/TO16S.seqs

```

I know have ALL of the TO sequences in the directory TO16S.seqs, but I need only the 16S sequences and not the ITS sequences. I'll have to use the barcode names in the fasta files to filter the sequences and keep only the 16S.

Let's start with setting up a directory I can add the filtered (16S only) sequences to:

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
cd

cd /TO16S/TO16S.seqs

mkdir TO16S_filtered 
```

I used google sheets to save Anna's primer names for the 16S samples only and then used ="TO_"&A:A&"_"&B:B to combine the F and R primers into one cohesive sample name/file name. I then copied all of the names I made and pasted them into a text file. 

```{bash, eval = FALSE}

```
