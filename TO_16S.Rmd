Let's copy TO sequence into a separate directory within my username that I can work on without ruining the raw data.

okaygirl so this is what you do:

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
ssh -p 22345 -l bklong bogarprecision.plb.ucdavis.edu

mkdir TO16S

cd TO16S

mkdir TO16S.seqs

cd

cd /data/Metabarcoding_DeepOaks_TejonOaks/p56ofydo/Unaligned/Project_LBAG_TODO_LP_MP1/

ls -d ~/TO16S/TO16S.seqs #checks to see if directory is found before trying to copy

cp TO* ~/TO16S/TO16S.seqs

```

I know have ALL of the TO sequences in the directory TO16S.seqs, but I need only the 16S sequences and not the ITS sequences. I'll have to use the barcode names in the fasta files to filter the sequences and keep only the 16S.
